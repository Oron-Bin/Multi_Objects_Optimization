# Overview

## Project Description
This project presents a Python-based approach to PID controller tuning employing multi-objective optimization algorithms, specifically NSGA-II and MOEA/D. The aim is to optimize the PID parameters (Proportional, Integral, Derivative gains) to achieve a desired performance in controlling a DC motor, balancing between competing objectives such as minimizing the Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) and Integral Square Error (ISE).

## Objectives
- Optimize the PID parameters to improve DC motor control performance.
- Balance between competing objectives like ITAE and ISE.

## Key Features
- Implementation of PID optimization problem tailored for DC motor control.
- Utilization of NSGA-II and MOEA/D algorithms from the PyMOO library.
