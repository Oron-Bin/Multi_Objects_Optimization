This project presents a Python-based approach to PID controller tuning employing multi-objective optimization algorithms, specifically NSGA-II and MOEA/D. The aim is to optimize the PID parameters (Proportional, Integral, Derivative gains) to achieve a desired performance in controlling a DC motor, balancing between competing objectives such as minimizing the Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) and Integral Square Error (ISE).

Features
Implementation of PID optimization problem tailored for DC motor control.
Utilization of NSGA-II and MOEA/D algorithms from the PyMOO library.
